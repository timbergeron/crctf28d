The Clanring CTF Home server gives clans a enhanced way to play matches, a rally timer for even starts, enhaced stats and scoring and easily
accessable server settings with a simple 4 digit admin code.  It can also function as a regular Threewav CTF4 server in skirmish mode while giving
the ability for players to warp to any level they choose.  Most servers will prolly be set to run in skirmish mode on the servers public port and in
Clanring mode on the private port.  
  

Basic Setup 

What you get in the crctf2x.* file: 

This document in html format and MS Word format. 

The crctf2x.txt file with basic info and version updates. 

A progs folder containing all the Crctf qc files. 

Fastqcc.exe, the best qc compiler avaliable today.   NOTE: fastqcc MAY have problems compiling the latest version of CRCTF.  For this reason it is currently not included in this archive.  If you experience problems with it, use a more basic compiler like qccdos.

A sample autoexec.cfg for the server itself. 

Instructions - Setup 

There are only a couple steps that need to be taken to setup a clanring server.  This setup is done by setting a couple of variables and recompiling
the server code.  All settings are located in the settings.qc file.  These settings are as follows. 

ADMIN_CODE_REAL ==> the 4 digit code used to get admin powers 

LOCKOUT ==> Default value for lockout  1 enables, 0 disables 

LOCK_NUM ==> Default value for lockmax, 2 => 8   0 disables 

DEBUGGING ==> Do not turn this on unless testing, removes all security from server. 

TEAM_CAPTURE_CUSTOM ==> 1 enables, 0 disables.  This is the custom Threewave CTF files, you want to run this, except under extremely rare
circumstances.  

OBSERVER_ENTRY ==> 1 enables, 0 disables.  Whether or not you enter the server as an observer.  

FORCE_RESPAWN ==> the number of seconds till players are automatically respawned, 0 disables 

LOCK_LEVEL ==> locks the game onto a single level 1 enables, 0 disables 

TM_SV_AIM ==> if sv_aim 0.93 should be used in teamplay; 1 enables, 0 disables 

OVERRIDE_VOTES ==> percentage of players needed to start timer with override function 

AUTO_RESPAWN ==> How long before a player auotmatically respawns.  

USE_PLS ==> 1 if the PLS (see below) should be used, 0 for CTF default. Skirmish mode 

CORPSES ==>1 if you want the dead bodies around, 0 to have a clean floor 

NORUNES ==> 1 for no runes, 0 for runes.

EXPANDED_MAPS ==> 0 if you only have the Threewave maps, 1 if you only have Threewave + Expansion, 2 if you have the complete All-Star map set (recommended). 

 The next things you want to take care of are the server greeting messages, what a player sees when he connects.  The greeting can be anything
you want as long as it contains the string “Running Clanring CTF Home Server v2.8” as the second line.                                              

SERVER_GREETING_CLANRING ==> This is what a player will see if entering in Clanring mode. 

SERVER_GREETING_RED ==> This is what the player will see if entering while the server is in skirmish mode and is put on the red team. 

SERVER _GREETING_BLUE ==> This is what the player will see if entering while the server is in skirmish mode and is put on the blue team. 

SERVER_GREETING_OBSERVER_CR ==> This is what the player will see when entering as an obserever in Clanring mode 

SERVER_GREETING_OBSERVER_SK ==> This is what the player will see when entering as an obserever in Skirmish mode 
  

Next you’ll want to set the level sequence, you get to run through 25 levels, if you don’t have 25 levels you want to cycle through just put  “none”
in the slot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Example: 

level_1 = "ctf1"; 

level_2 = "ctf2"; 

level_3 = "ctf3"; 

level_4 = "ctf4"; 

level_5 = "ctf5"; 

level_6 = "ctf6"; 

level_7 = "ctf7"; 

level_8 = "ctf8"; 

level_7 = "ctf2m1"; 

level_8 = "ctf2m2"; 

level_9 = "ctf2m3"; 

level_10 = "ctf2m4"; 

level_11 = "ctf2m5"; 

level_12 = "ctf2m6"; 

level_13 = "ctf2m7"; 

level_14 = "ctf2m8"; 

level_15 = "none"; 

level_16 = "none"; 

level_17 = "none"; 

level_18 = "none"; 

level_19 = "none"; 

level_20 = "none"; 

level_21 = "none"; 

level_22 = "none"; 

level_23 = "none"; 

level_24 = "none"; 

level_25 = "none"; 

  

You will also set your custom level names here if you have any.  In addition, set a "description" for the map which is its full name.

Example (with some made-up map names):

custom_1 = "lilmap"; 
custom_1_description = "Littlemap";

custom_2 = "kaboom"; 
custom_2_description = "KaBoom CTF"

custom_3 = "prtyhrty"; 
custom_3_description = "Party Hearty";

custom_4 = "none"; 
custom_4_description = "N/A";

custom_5 = "none"; 
custom_5_description = "N/A";

custom_6 = "none"; 
custom_6_description = "N/A";

custom_7 = "none"; 
custom_7_description = "N/A";

custom_8 = "none"; 
custom_8_description = "N/A";

custom_9 = "none";
custom_9_description = "N/A";

custom_10 = "none";
custom_10_description = "N/A";

custom_11 = "none";
custom_11_description = "N/A";

custom_12 = "none";  
custom_12_description = "N/A";


Thats all the qc files you will have to modify, after you set these variables run your QuakeC compiler in the progs directory.  This will create the
progs.dat for the server, next you’ll have to set the samelevel and other server settings in the autoexec.cfg. 

The samelevel variable works like the teamplay one in CTF.  Add up the features you want, and the total is your samelevel setting.  Most likely,
you'll want to run "samelevel 7".  (you want the server to run in non-clanring mode by default, and have it switch to clanring when you need it for
competition)  

TEAM_HEALTH_PROTECT = 1; // No health damage from friendly fire 

TEAM_ARMOR_PROTECT =  2; // No armor damage from friendly fire 

TEAM_DROP_ITEMS =  4;// Allow players to drop packs and weapons 

CLANRING_MODE =  8;// Clanring competition mode 

TEAM_STATIC_TEAMS  = 16;//Don’t allow players to change teams in Skirmish mode  

FLIMIT_MODE =  32;  // If in CR mode we end match by frags 

TLIMIT_MODE =   64; // If in CR mode we end match by time 

When you set the hostname it would proable be helpful to put “CRCTF 2.8” somewhere in the name.  And when you set the teamplay variable in  
the server.cfg or autoexec.cfg make sure you have teamplay 1?CRCTF so it will work with the included Qspy tab. 

  

Commands - Players 

Red(implse 233) ==> Sets player color to 4. 

Blue(impulse 234) ==> Sets player color to 13. 

Ready(impulse 40) ==> this signals the server that you are ready to play and you'd like to be placed on a team.  It will then place you on a team if
you pant color matches one of the team pant colors, or it will create a new team if it doesn't.  You cannot join a team when you pants color is white. 
If you receive the error "Invalid Color" you either have white pants or there are already 2 teams and your color doesn't match either of them.  Use
"playerlist" to see the existing team colors.  The ready command will also give you your 3 digit ghost id code, you will need this code if you get
disconnected and you try to re-enter the game.  Note:  When all players on a server have joined teams and the game is not being run by an
observer, the game will automatically start at 1 minute countdown, once this is up, the match will begin. 

NotReady(impulse 41) ==> this says that you're not happy with your current team.  It will remove you from your team and eliminate your team if you
were the last person remaining.  It will also stop the countdown if the game is being run without an observer. If a match is in progress and you are
on a team your frags will be set to zero and you will be made an observer. 

Observer(impulse 42) ==> this removes you from your team and makes you an observer.  You can view the match without interferring as an
observer.  You may also pass through doors and teleporters in observer mode.  Note:  If you join a match in progress or if the match starts and you
do not have a team, you will automatically be made an observer.  You can type "Ready" to join a team if you are an observer, even if match is in
progress. 

Camera(impulse 171) ==> this removes you from your team and makes you a camera.  You can view the match without interferring as an observer. 
Jump will let you move between cameras. 

Playerlist(impulse 80) ==> a very valuable command, this allows you to see the status of everyone on the server and to see what the pant colors of
the existing teams are.  It will also denote who is and admin as well as observer. 

Ghost(impulse 50) ==> this command allows you to rejoin a game as yourself if you get disconnected from the server.  The game will then prompt
you for your 3 digit code that you were given when you typed "ready".  

Warp(impulse 48) ==> allows changing of levels.  If you are not an admin, you need the approval of half of the people on the server, or a minimum
of 3 people to change levels.  After you type in "warp" and hit enter, you will be given a episode listing type in the episode number and hit enter
and then hit the level number.  It will then request that the remaining people on the server confirm that this is where you want to go.  Once a
sufficient number of people have typed "yes" at the console, the level will change.  Note:  Episode 5 are the deathmatch levels, Episode 6 is the
ctfstart level, Episode 7 are the CTF 3.x levels, Episode 8 are the CTF 4.x levels, and Episode 9 are your custom levels. 

Commands(impulse 99) ==> gives a listing of all available commands. 

Admin(impulse 51) ==> initiates admin authorization sequence.  You are prompted for the 4 digit code.  If you are unsuccessful at typing the code
more than a couple times, the game assumes you are trying to hack the server and disconnects you.  If you are already an admin, you will become a
normal observer.

     sporting events.  

ChaseCam (impulse 201) ==> This removes you from your team and enters you into ChaseCam 
     Mode.  In this Observer Mode, you follow behind the selected player at an over the shoulder 
     perspective.  Similar to the view of some third-person games like Tomb Raider.  Pressing Jump 
     will switch between players.  

AutoChase (impulse ) ==> This is an automated version of ChaseCam, in which the game 
     automatically follows the most exciting player to watch.  

QuakeTV (impulse 207) ==> Toggles QuakeTV system which is a combination of AutoChase and 
     AutoCam.  

AutoWeapon (impulse 87) ==> Toggles AutoWeapon Switching Modes.  OFF = No autoweapon 
     switching period.  SMART = Changes to weapon when you pick it up or get ammo for it, except

     pack.  ON = Normal Quake AutoWeapon Switching.  

Vkick (impulse252) ==> Allows players to kick other players off the server by a majority vote.  Skirmish mode only. 

Smooth(impulse205)==>Uses some packet editing to "smooth out" the Chasecam view. 

Freelook(impulse209)==>Allows you to guide your own viewpoint, much like holding the fire button in Faq-proxy. 

Statusbar(impulse70)==>Turns off the CTF and QuakeTV status bars, use impulses 71 to 81 to set it back.  They carry the same value as in native 
3wave ctf.
